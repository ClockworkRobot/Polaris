Polaris
==============

Our initial aim when attempting this project was to create a simple and relatively cheap kit for schools, colleges and home users to explore the skys in a new and interesting way. The prototype of this kit was constructed with a modified sponge missile launcher, a common webcam, a raspberry pi and some simple components soldered to a prototyping board. Although the prototype does not have any telescopic lenses, it works well as a proof of concept that a product such as this is a viable venture.

We have been able to implement command line and web based controls for the motorized camera base including a web based stream of the live pictures, functionality could be implemented to allow an authority to claim control of the gear if required. This implementation can be seen on the code repository.

The finished kit would consist of a printed PCB and the required components to populate them, a raspberry pi with accessories to set it up, a die or laser cut structure including stepper motors and a dobsonian style telescope with a low cost webcam as a receiving device. All components would be available separately allowing complete customization user's liking. This approach has been proven viable by projects such as the RepRap.
